The application is now deployed. Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running:
$ heroku ps:scale web=1
Now visit the app at the URL generated by its app name. As a handy shortcut, you can open the website as follows:
$ heroku open

 heroku logs --tail

 heroku ps
=== web (Free): `vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2`
web.1: up 2014/05/27 12:03:23 (~ 11m ago)

 heroku ps:scale web=0
Access the app again by hitting refresh on the web tab, or heroku open to open it in a web tab. You will get an error message because you no longer have any web dynos available to serve requests.
Scale it up again:
$ heroku ps:scale web=1


{
  "require" : {
    "silex/silex": "~1.3",
    "monolog/monolog": "~1.7",
    "twig/twig": "^1.19",
    "symfony/twig-bridge": "^2.7"
  },
  "require-dev": {
    "heroku/heroku-buildpack-php": "*"
  }
}
The composer.json file specifies the dependencies that should be installed with your application. When an app is deployed, Heroku reads this file and installs the appropriate dependencies into the vendor directory.
Your PHP app can then make use of the dependencies after a simple require:
require('../vendor/autoload.php');



 composer update
Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies (including require-dev)
  - Installing psr/log (1.0.0)
    Loading from cache
...
Writing lock file







 composer require alrik11es/cowsayphp
This will also change composer.json. If you introduced the dependency by modifying the composer.json file yourself, be sure to update the dependencies by running:
$ composer update
Now modify index.php to use this library. Add a new route after the existing one, for /cowsay:
$app->get('/cowsay', function() use($app) {
  $app['monolog']->addDebug('cowsay');
  return "<pre>".\Cowsayphp\Cow::say("Cool beans")."</pre>";
});
When that route is visited, it will render a beautiful cow.
Now deploy. Almost every deploy to Heroku follows this same pattern.
First, add the modified files to the local git repository:
$ git add .
Now commit the changes to the repository:
$ git commit -m "Demo"



 git push heroku master
Finally, check that everything is working:
$ heroku open cowsay
